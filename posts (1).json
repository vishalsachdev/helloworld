I started college with a completely different engineering major and planned on going toward medical school. I realized after getting involved with other organizations and opportunities that I wanted to pursue something different than medicine. My short-term goals are to work in the consulting field. I am currently in a consulting internship for this summer and am very much enjoying the career trajectory I decided on. My long-term goals are to potentially use my knowledge from consulting across industries with a focus on social impact and utilize that background towards aiding my background and community. I come from a background where immigrating to the U.S. is a struggle but to thrive is harder. I have been a part of a non-profit that connects my background within the States and aids others around us and back in Egypt. How this relates to my long-term goals is to aid organizations and companies coming from my community to thrive within the U.S. market with a goal to help others. Technology and information have a large impact on both my long-term goals and short-term goals. For example, I am currently working at a company that specializes in Technology. I am constantly surrounded by projects that are technology-oriented and their impact. Long-term wise, technology and information are the reason why I am able to connect with my community on the other side of the world. With this impact, I am able to hopefully achieve the goals I set out for myself. What I am currently doing to ensure I have the skills needed to compete is by going into an industry that is informed about the constant change in technology and information. Consultants need to be aware of what is happening around them to succeed in the field. I also plan on learning these skills through self-improvement.&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 9702, "anonymous_id": "7hi", "display_name": "Alexandra Hosny", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7428391/yYZxQUeUk2nmDQu1bhuseGrtAT3HcetKVg2Yr624", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/9702", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}, {"id": 1843260, "user_id": 127195, "parent_id": null, "created_at": "2023-06-19T04:52:02Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T04:52:02Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Kevin Esquivel", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p><span>I am currently a senior at UIUC and I am studying Spanish with a minor in business as well as learning on the side to get my plumbing license.

You have a very significant set of ambitious goals. It is fantastic for you to study Spanish as it is a beneficial and universal degree. It will help you out, especially in owning a septic service company. I agree with your stance on the importance of integrating and learning about information systems and technology advancements. Even reading the chapter we just finished, we discussed the importance of firms and companies making innovative transitions by 2030 to increase their cash flow. Especially since you are interested in operating a business, catching an early eye on what technology a septic company might lack would help build a successful one down the line. &nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 51352, "anonymous_id": "13mg", "display_name": "Julio Cornejo", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7561750/1yaUDQ3LqOI0GNcR8LVTccExwQdyIhX0uVNnSiRb", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/51352", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}], "has_more_replies": false}, {"id": 1843129, "user_id": 334283, "parent_id": null, "created_at": "2023-06-19T03:35:23Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T03:35:23Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Kacper Majka", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>I am in the Gies College of Business studying Management.

Long term goal I want to be able to work for myself one day and be able to spend as much time with my family and not work all day and be stuck with only two weeks of vacation a year. I want to be able to travel and explore as much as I can. I believe by setting myself up with my own business I would be able to achieve this.

As I want to work as a Data Scientist, information and technology play an incredible role in my career path. Data Science is the application of information systems and technology to discover noteworthy trends in data, so it is safe to say that information and technology is the most important aspect of my career choice.

I have access to multiple certification programs designed to acquaint business students and employees with data science and information technology, and I should do these types of things.&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 76656, "anonymous_id": "1n5c", "display_name": "Mary Therese Thavis", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7612902/tS8RoDKShKQ25KXy35wpZYYfdh9d4f8yR4cduvYc", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/76656", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1843268, "user_id": 127195, "parent_id": 1843016, "created_at": "2023-06-19T04:56:57Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T04:56:57Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Kevin Esquivel", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hola Mary,</p>\n<p>I completely agree with your perspective on the importance of being comfortable and familiar with different data-processing technologies in order to succeed in marketing.

This is a combination of majors that you do not see very often. I chose these two majors because of one of my mentors from freshman year of college. I was intrigued by the challenge of taking different courses and wanted to expand my knowledge of business as much as I could. My short-term goal is to continue to work hard at my internship this summer with PepsiCo. I want to learn as much as I can about financial reporting processes and to successfully deliver my project. Another short-term goal I have is to secure a full-time offer for after graduation by the end of this upcoming fall semester. For my long-term career goals, I want to always be in a role where I feel challenged. I want to always be learning new things and to be making my work impactful. Also, I want to have a good work-life balance. My family and friends are very important to me, so I want to ensure that in my job I can have time for both. In my career, I know that technology and information will play a big role. There are already many different technology platforms and Python skills that I am learning in my internship currently. To try and sharpen my skills to compete, I currently use LinkedIn Learning. The videos and tests on their are very helpful in learning new skills. Also, you normally get a virtual certificate after you finish a course!</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 25898, "anonymous_id": "jze", "display_name": "Allison Cerullo", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7451489/UeEvubbr3INPZn4gBaFLcI6WeLGiKVm6CyBSCsOt", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/25898", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1843118, "user_id": 350544, "parent_id": 1842895, "created_at": "2023-06-19T03:30:19Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T03:30:19Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Jake Ash", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p><span>Hey Allison, the fact that one of your long-term goals is to constantly be challenged is quite inspiring! Constantly challenging yourself is the best way to master your field, and realizing that this early on is quite a feat. While striving to constantly learn and challenge yourself is admirable, the fact you have a set boundary around work-life balance is also quite admirable. People can get too caught up in their careers and miss other important parts of life, so noticing this as well is amazing.

After this, I will begin a graduate program on Technology Management since I have been developing an interest in topics related to business and technology lately. My short term goals are to finish this one year program and learn the most from it. I would like to have the opportunity of completing and internship at a company like amazon while on grad school. My long term goals are to be an entrepreneur and have a business of my own. As of now I'm not sure yet what is it that I want to do but I know that I want it to be related to the tech industry. Technology and information will play an important role in my career path since I will be focusing on this area for the following year. Additionally, I believe it is extremely important to learn about emerging technologies and how to take advantage of them since technology is implemented in almost every aspect of a business. I am really interested in learning more about e-commerce and blockchain technology.

In terms of an internship, as long as you can network and ask the right questions to the right people and practice interview questions, you will achieve or land a desirable role.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 51352, "anonymous_id": "13mg", "display_name": "Julio Cornejo", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7561750/1yaUDQ3LqOI0GNcR8LVTccExwQdyIhX0uVNnSiRb", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/51352", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}], "has_more_replies": false}, {"id": 1842828, "user_id": 114729, "parent_id": null, "created_at": "2023-06-19T01:35:32Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T01:35:32Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Ashwin Vaidyanathan", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi everybody my name is Ashwin Vaidyanathan. I am a rising Junior studying Finance and Information Systems with a minor in Economics. In terms of my short term goals, I would say the biggest thing for me right now is to potentially go into strategy consulting. For example as of right now I am currently recruiting for an internship at a consulting firm next summer. Hopefully soon after I will pursue a full time career in consulting. Long Term I am not sure, but I think by the time I am thirty I would have loved to travel through Europe and parts of Asia. In my career path there a lot of different implications especially recently. For example with Open AI there has been a lot of changes and understanding in the industry. Consulting is very research heavy service and now with AI and things like chatgpt it is completely streamlined and done by an AI. With strategy as well, there is a lot of understanding that is needed about the tech industry as whole. For example one of the things or skills I need to have is proficiency with the actual tech to be able to understand the market more. One way I can do this is by taking initiative to code.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 114729, "anonymous_id": "2gix", "display_name": "Ashwin Vaidyanathan", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7527466/9consAP6sLGJDzhObHvgJGah3oGswGXppiMwZtBh", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/114729", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}, {"id": 1842707, "user_id": 29810, "parent_id": null, "created_at": "2023-06-19T00:20:44Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T00:20:44Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "David Diep", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>I am studying accountancy and information systems. My short-term career goals are to graduate and become a CPA at an accounting firm. My long-term career goals are to have a career that aligns with my strengths and interests, whether that be in public accounting or private. It's no doubt that technology and information will play a huge role in my career path. As I want to work as a CPA, numbers that I use will all be recorded by information systems. Therefore, it's important in becoming competent in being able to utilize information systems, otherwise I would lack skills that are needed to be a CPA. Further, as I mentioned working at an accounting firm previously, many accounting firms have started tech consulting practices to add on to their tax and audit practices. It turns out that in many cases, the tech consulting practice becomes one of their biggest practices. Therefore, if I want to be part of that practice, then I need to be able to learn and be knowledgeable about information technology. One thing I could be doing to ensure that I have the skills needed is search for opportunities such as internships with companies that embrace advancements to technology, so I can learn from them.&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 29810, "anonymous_id": "n02", "display_name": "David Diep", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7517971/4euh2xKeF3J32IrFx4KextQ4l1wtlelstIoyloIl", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/29810", "pronouns": "He/Him"}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1842861, "user_id": 40425, "parent_id": 1842707, "created_at": "2023-06-19T01:52:13Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T01:52:13Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Giulia Boggio", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi David!

My long term career goals are to do something that allows me to have flexibility in my personal life as well as to be apart of an organization with strong characteristics and morals. Technology and information will consist of almost everything I do in my career as I am majoring in finance and information systems so that will lead to everything I do being centered around technology with financial modeling and data analytics. I think I should be taking courses more heavily focused on the tech world as well as public skill courses where I can improve my abilities in different operating platforms and languages like python and SQL. I also need to start paying more attention to the rapid advancement of AI and how that will affect my future career. Overall, technology will be the single most important piece of my future career and I must dedicate more effort to being aware of the state of technology.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 121357, "anonymous_id": "2ln1", "display_name": "Nick Borcia", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7804596/2P05I3ZYlNCfIXaFG6PC5rvnHlPohL1HGVPMckIU", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/121357", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}, {"id": 1842434, "user_id": 51352, "parent_id": null, "created_at": "2023-06-18T20:17:33Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-18T20:19:01Z", "editor_id": 51352, "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Julio Cornejo", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>I am studying computer engineering. As someone majoring in computer engineering, there is a sweet duality of understanding the conceptual makeup of electrical engineering and computer science. As a rising senior, my short-term goal is graduation. I want to make sure I can create a comfortable schedule to finish some of my curriculum's most challenging classes. Taking technical courses alongside this one this summer is a step forward. I aim to become a hardware engineer because I love computer design and logic gates and have created video games in a hardware description language. Companies like NVIDIA interest me, although I will humbly begin with any offer that comes my way. Technology plays a significant role in almost every job I envision myself working. I can see myself working or writing code in many different languages depending on the job I wish to pursue. For instance, I am interested in AI, so taking a course like CS 440 will be a great starting point. With the rise of AI, I can hopefully pursue a job in advancing and discovering new tools for AI. Many jobs would require basic or standard skills in document drafting applications like Word or the entire Microsoft suite for developing presentations. These skills will be needed, especially since hardware engineering and software engineering requires working in larger teams. More specifically, ChatGPT is a newer technology that has code-writing capability. Thus, using it as a reference instead of a replacement can sharpen approaches for solving algorithmic problems. The best way to compete in the competitive software and electrical engineering job market is to understand the interview process. Learning the questions that may be asked and sharpening your programming languages by any means. Also, starting on summer projects and showing interest outside of coursework is essential. These are all approaches I will be using to land a post-graduation job, hopefully.&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 51352, "anonymous_id": "13mg", "display_name": "Julio Cornejo", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7561750/1yaUDQ3LqOI0GNcR8LVTccExwQdyIhX0uVNnSiRb", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/51352", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1842874, "user_id": 40425, "parent_id": 1842434, "created_at": "2023-06-19T01:58:50Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T01:58:50Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Giulia Boggio", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Julio!

I have a big interest in financial markets and how they work, as well as how technology impacts business. In the short term, I am hopeful to move to the city and start working at a financial consulting firm, I don't know which firm yet, but some place I can start my career. My long term goals are to work my way up the ladder of the company, or move to another company to take promotions. I want to one day be able to travel the world and have a comfortable living. I am hopeful that technology and information will play a huge role in my future career path. Technology has been steadily taking over the financial industry since the mid to late 80s, with exponential growth ever since. Combined with the information systems I learn at UIUC, I am hopeful these will be at the forefront of my future career. Now, as a student, I need to study hard in classes I take both in Finance and Information Systems in order to have the skills necessary to excel in my future role. During this course, I will need to learn as much as I can, as the time in college is for preperation for the future.&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 34758, "anonymous_id": "qti", "display_name": "Eddie Esgar", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7579596/G7wyo6Vksl2BMG6rVSD0FBP01iod6yyGT6Sm1clb", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/34758", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}, {"id": 1842068, "user_id": 21973, "parent_id": null, "created_at": "2023-06-18T10:45:07Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-18T10:45:07Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Chunke Munke Deleon", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi, I am currently studying computer science in the college of engineering with a minor in business. My short-term goals are definitely to get an internship at a big tech firm like Google or Microsoft, and then, graduate and work new grad there or at another big tech company. Long-term I plan to bounce around between similar companies until I find a place that I am comfortable at and would want to stay at. Considering I am trying to go into big tech, technology will play a massive role in this career path. I seek to actively develop new technology, so I have to be immersed in current trends and ingrain myself deeply into the development process of technology while leveraging technological tools created by others to make development easier. In terms of short term competition, I need to prep for interviews first by studying common technical interview questions through leetcode, but also by gaining actual experience in the development cycle (which I am currently doing at the company I am interning at) that I can talk about during interviews. Long-term to keep competitive I need to develop my experience not just in coding but communication and planning.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 21973, "anonymous_id": "gyd", "display_name": "Chunke Munke Deleon", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7644810/TkNIb6bFxpEe8xWXFvRBN5EhMTTan8LEuuqkqWbF", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/21973", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1846146, "user_id": 29810, "parent_id": 1842068, "created_at": "2023-06-21T20:42:48Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-21T20:46:38Z", "editor_id": 29810, "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "David Diep", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Chunke, I think it's a really favorable idea to gain experience at different companies to find the one that will suit you best, as you think about your long-term career. You mentioned the importance of keeping up with technological trends, so I believe that taking classes such as this one will help at learning some of those trends and I know sources that take the form of articles and podcasts can help you learn about technological advances too.

I am thinking about studying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as my specific area of Interest. My short-term career goal is to go to the Big tech companies. My dream company is Google since I like their work ethic and how it is a lateral relationship. From the experience I gain from working there, my long-term career goal is to start up my own IT company. It can be either a web service or an innovative app. In order to achieve this, I chose Business as my minor to learn business management skills. Technology and Information is literally my path. Working at an IT company as a software developer, I would go to the frontier and confront new technological breakthroughs. I will be making the projects that clients request. In order to ensure that I have the creativity and comprehensive understanding of the trend, I should have the will to search for new technologies and keep up with the different opinions of tech gurus. I have to utilise news feed apps and LinkedIn to follow recent tech news. Also, I need to subscribe to tech youtube that summarises the weekly debrief for me.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 47171, "anonymous_id": "10eb", "display_name": "Max Min", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7672497/VZdOppW1pADfF8HSfeWlxPQQomctdguM4G2swvbv", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/47171", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1842069, "user_id": 21973, "parent_id": 1842045, "created_at": "2023-06-18T10:52:40Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-18T10:52:40Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Chunke Munke Deleon", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Max, I see we have a pretty similar background as well as similar initial career goals. I think your strategy for keeping up your skills is pretty sound for your long term goal. I can't give much advice, but I can comment a little bit on AI/ML at this school since you are considering that as your specific area of interest. I would say CS440 is a decent course if you want to be exposed to a lot of areas and are not sure what you really want to do. CS444 is cool if you like generative AI and neural nets.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 21973, "anonymous_id": "gyd", "display_name": "Chunke Munke Deleon", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7644810/TkNIb6bFxpEe8xWXFvRBN5EhMTTan8LEuuqkqWbF", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/21973", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}], "has_more_replies": false}, {"id": 1842031, "user_id": 116470, "parent_id": null, "created_at": "2023-06-18T06:54:06Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-18T06:54:06Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "David Waraksa", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>I am studying both Finance and Operations Management, two majors which focus heavily on optimization.&nbsp; In the short term, I want to find a career position as either a project analyst for a firm, or to hold a position in banking, and in the long term, I wish to be able to work at a high level position in the field of banking.&nbsp; I feel that technology will be incredibly important to aid my skills in both Operations and Finance.&nbsp; For Operational skills, a large amount of optimization, whether when dealing with a new product, analyzing the profitability of a project, or finding the most cost efficient way to implement a new system, technology will greatly help me to understand how a company's current operations will change from new projects, products, or systems.&nbsp; For Finance, a large amount of programs currently exist to help understand market data, with a standout being Bloomberg's market analytics programs and the Bloomberg terminal, and I believe that understanding how to use these products will greatly help me in addition to the mandatory programs which Finance requires, such as Excel.&nbsp; To ensure that I can gain and maintain my skills, I will regularly check for updates in programs which I already have an understanding of, and I will consistently use Excel to become an expert in it.&nbsp; Additionally, I will look out for new programs that can be used for Financial Modeling or Analysis, allowing for me to stay up to date with the world of Finance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 116470, "anonymous_id": "2hva", "display_name": "David Waraksa", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7470404/XUfiZ3OBEc4gk45RMQ4RYxO3J4cV5xIQMJbftMjm", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/116470", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1842409, "user_id": 34758, "parent_id": 1842031, "created_at": "2023-06-18T20:01:30Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-18T20:01:30Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Eddie Esgar", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi David!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think your goals are great and very achievable with your work ethic.

That will play a large role if I want to continue down the accounting path or integrate into a mix or go purely information systems based. Additionally, I am considering getting my master\u2019s in accounting. Currently, I am more interested in accounting but that will most likely change through coursework and job experience. My long-term goals are much simpler than my short-term goals and to be honest I really just want to have a good work-life balance.

A lot of the material learned in the early accounting courses is automated but is still important to know.

I am currently shadowing for a small marketing company where I am learning how to market for different companies. I am unsure of what my long term goal is, but I know I want to do something with marketing. I chose to do Information Systems because I know how important technology is with marketing. Technology can be used to create a board, website, social media post and so much more. It is also used to analyze the data that is put out there by a company. You are able to find what works for your company and what does not work through the analysis of technology. In order to ensure my technology skills are well rounded, I should be practicing creating different posts for different ideas.

My long-term goal is to start my own financial advising firm and build a solid team. This is my ultimate long-term goal because it will allow me complete control over the quality of help I will give people. Technology will play a significant role in my career path. Technology makes life easier for financial planners since it can simplify the process. It can quickly create projections and hypotheses for you and your client. Information will also be a significant player in my career path. Financial information is critical to success as a financial advisor, allowing you to make proper and successful plans for a client. Mixing technology and information, you can create an app that shows this information to clients so they can be updated on everything happening with their money. Besides continuing my college education, to ensure I have the skills to compete in my future career field, I must continue to learn about these technologies and better ways to create more accurate projections. Discovering the best ways to invest money for the short and long term and to make sure portfolios are appropriately diversified.&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 322888, "anonymous_id": "6x54", "display_name": "Scott Buchanan", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7622620/dfjnEKIVHBvE6TsKFNc0z0Jf7kDK8LJyYZphrfN2", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/322888", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1846613, "user_id": 76656, "parent_id": 1841346, "created_at": "2023-06-22T03:59:32Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-22T03:59:32Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Mary Therese Thavis", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Scott,</p>\n<p>I think the way you're thinking long-term is wonderful.

I'm unsure of my short-term and long-term career goals. There are many career options related to my major and some that are entirely different. In the past, I've worked in analytics on marketing teams for companies within the media industry. These roles required different skillsets where one was focused primarily on data visualization and the other was in qualitative research. After working in these positions, I'm reconsidering what I'd like to do after graduation. With my degree in statistics, I can work in academia as well. Regardless, all these experiences have required the use of technology for computation and presentation. Some of the most common software programs I've used include R, Python, Tableau, Excel, and Powerpoint. If I choose to continue in this industry, I'll have to maintain a base knowledge of current technology. Knowing how to use AI like ChatGpT is quickly becoming a requirement for job seekers. For the future, it's important that I continue learning new software programs so I can stay competitive in the professional world. Adaptability is a large component of the success I've seen in my short career, and I'm certain that having a flexible attitude will be pertinent as technology evolves.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 13160, "anonymous_id": "a5k", "display_name": "Alice Cao", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7655155/3AhqT4IKiHTi0d5s6wK5tPXuTDbukfHjtavDVErk", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/13160", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1844990, "user_id": 25898, "parent_id": 1841026, "created_at": "2023-06-21T00:49:38Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-21T00:49:38Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Allison Cerullo", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\">Hi Alice,<div>I am also studying marketing!

I am Sara Nemec. I am a rising junior at the Gies College of Business. I am majoring in Accountancy and Information Systems. I chose the major of Accountancy because I was inspired by my high school accounting teacher Mrs. Norway. I do my best because I have high expectations for my future. I aspire to be successful and make my mom proud, therefore I am following a path to my dream career. I want to work in Chicago for an accounting firm. I have been working and interviewing with a couple firms. I have recently accepted an offer for next year to work as an intern downtown. I am so happy about it! This is one step closer to reach my short term goal of working at an accounting firm. My long-term goal is to become partner at a major accounting firm in Chicago. The reason I chose to pursue Information Systems along with my other major is because it will teach me some basic IT skills that will prove helpful in my future profession as an accountant. I should continue working hard towards my goals in order for me to develop the necessary skills I need to compete.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 122702, "anonymous_id": "2moe", "display_name": "Sara Nemec", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7486043/FGfhWlP6Z4to4EcWCdhyyB9S7TTKQ8Lw0C00u5Zj", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/122702", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1846608, "user_id": 76656, "parent_id": 1840915, "created_at": "2023-06-22T03:56:50Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-22T03:56:50Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Mary Therese Thavis", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Sara,</p>\n<p>I love to hear how passionate you are about you career path!

In terms of short term goals, I want to pursue a internship in IT or finance operations and to graduate after this next school year. My long term career goal is to own and run my own business, but I am unsure what type of business or what the goal of my business would be. Technology and information have already played a huge role in my career path as an IT intern and will continue to play a large part in the future. The use of technology in society and business is going to continue to increase as time goes on and people that understand how and when to use technology efficiently will be instrumental to many different organizations. As an operations management major being able to implement information and technology effectively through databases, inventory management systems, Tableau, and many other applications will be important to being successful in the future. To ensure that I have the skills to compete I am going to have to keep up to date with current systems used in ops management by businesses and also future technologies that could be used effectively. Technology is always changing and keeping ahead of the curve and researching/using technologies that will be influential in the future is important. An example of this is our use of ChatGPT in this class. Many teachers do not allow students to use Chat GPT but in this class it is encouraged because it is the technology of the future and will be something that we may see in our future workplaces.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 51221, "anonymous_id": "13it", "display_name": "Jaydon Hostetter", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7412294/oQMXEYPXKGRisoRcZA1vTQv3uQh3Af1y990HSpsI", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/51221", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1842051, "user_id": 116470, "parent_id": 1840545, "created_at": "2023-06-18T08:24:37Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-18T08:24:37Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "David Waraksa", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hello Jaydon,<br>I find it very respectable that you wish to run your own business, and I feel that understanding the technologies related to running your own business will greatly benefit you, even if you have yet to begin the business.&nbsp; Additionally, I sympathize with your statement that you are unsure of what type of business you wish to start.&nbsp; I wanted to mention this in my own initial post, but I ended up deciding not to make this statement, as I am also unsure of the field that I would like to run a business in, or if I even have the capabilities to do so.&nbsp; However, I feel that you and I both can likely find success in our own future businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 116470, "anonymous_id": "2hva", "display_name": "David Waraksa", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7470404/XUfiZ3OBEc4gk45RMQ4RYxO3J4cV5xIQMJbftMjm", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/116470", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}], "has_more_replies": false}, {"id": 1840535, "user_id": 28176, "parent_id": null, "created_at": "2023-06-16T16:22:22Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-16T16:22:22Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Curtis Smith", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>I am currently studying Business Management. My current short term goal is to secure my enrollment into graduate school. More specifically graduate school here at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am unsure on the focus of choice, however, I have an interest in Human Resources. I would like to include in my short-term goals, securing an internship in the position of a human resource shadow or the likelihood of one being in relation to management. This will allow me to have more experience with my said focus interest. For a good portion of working life, I have been involved with people, or means of customer service. Looking at the business aspect and more internals I drew an interest in human resources.&nbsp; Long term wise, I have always had the aspiration to work for the company Google, as both intern and employee.

I hope to work for an accounting firm that I enjoy working at and move up within the firm over the years. Technology plays a huge role in my path towards an accounting career because everything is recorded on computers such as journalizing and posting transactions, making payments, creating financial statements, communicating with clients, etc. It is crucial to understand technology and have the information necessary in order to be successful in completing the necessary tasks, especially since technology is not going anywhere but will only advance. One thing I can do to ensure I have the skills needed to compete is to simply gain experience through internships or different accounting opportunities. I also need to be able to adapt, especially with the advancements in technology, in order to still be successful when changes occur. <span>&nbsp;</span></p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 62277, "anonymous_id": "1c1x", "display_name": "Karolina Rzadkosz", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/8768261/am50wnMRh0A1J1oSbVVG3bxzib3QlWQDpTT7jZjA", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/62277", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "read", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1843155, "user_id": 350544, "parent_id": 1840103, "created_at": "2023-06-19T03:42:44Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T03:42:44Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Jake Ash", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hey Karolina!

Also, being open to learning new ideas or experimenting with new technology is a great way to be prepared.&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 212123, "anonymous_id": "4job", "display_name": "Olivia Koziol", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7525320/rHBVVPU73J112LeXMZlozkjypNfXP156HMsYd9Sh", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/212123", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "read", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1841363, "user_id": 322888, "parent_id": 1838982, "created_at": "2023-06-17T04:20:35Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-17T04:20:35Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Scott Buchanan", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hello Olivia, operations management is a critical aspect of how a company or anything can succeed.

It terms of short-term goals I am just focusing on passing classes and graduating on time and I'll go from there. However, I am considering a corporate supply chain job, as last semester I took a co-op internship for Kimberly-Clark as a supply chain customer inventory analyst and enjoyed it a lot. A long-term goal of mine would be to eventually move more toward the brand development and brand management side of the business. Technology so far has played a major part in my career and I'm sure its role will only increase as I go further. Recently with my internship, I used technology for almost everything, more specifically I used SAP programs, Microsoft Excel, and other Microsoft programs every day. Also working with other people on the supply chain as well as shadowing other groups in brand management I saw other programs being used such as Power BI and Tableau. I think that every modern business that is making something of itself is at least technologically competent and those that really accel are the ones that know how to use technology to their advantage the best. I believe that to gain these skills to compete in the modern world is through experience. I know my internship helped me begin to understand what life could be like in the future, and I am looking to get one or two more internships to continue to help me develop my skills.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 122302, "anonymous_id": "2mda", "display_name": "Ryan Marks", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7560010/BhV8RNilUT51Di2CPjiOf3VaBzHATBu9PgBJzCa0", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/122302", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "read", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1846390, "user_id": 25898, "parent_id": 1838477, "created_at": "2023-06-22T01:16:40Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-22T01:16:40Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Allison Cerullo", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Ryan,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I like that your short-term goals are practical and very achievable.

In my current internship, I have also learned how to use SAP and more advanced tools in Microsoft Excel. It is so cool that we have learned so much from our internship experiences so far. Internships are a great way to experience different areas of business and find what we enjoy doing the most.

On top of this, I would need to use information to analyze financial-data, by measuring trends and risk, allowing myself to make investment recommendations and decisions. Technology plays a huge role in the finance industry as well, specifically in terms of new technologies, including blockchain. These include new currencies that are leading the charge in terms of decentralized finance, that don't directly respond to economic health. New technologies like Ai and Machine learning can also make trading easier and more efficient. Additionally, Technology firms will be a huge component of an investment portfolio. I will have to keep up to date in new technological advancements. To ensure I have the skills to compete in my desired career path, I will need to be able to process and utilize data to make decisions. I will have to possess strong analytical and quantitative skills to make financial models, understand companies financial performance, and overall assess investment opportunities. To gain these skills I need to be receiving real world experience in courses and internships, while going above and beyond by learning on my own time.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 22695, "anonymous_id": "hif", "display_name": "Tyler Bihun", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7632586/E1o8wXcLLfOLPTj3IrVurOKuDfzHnVs60ASZ1zgL", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/22695", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "read", "forced_read_state": false, "recent_replies": [{"id": 1843084, "user_id": 112437, "parent_id": 1837359, "created_at": "2023-06-19T03:16:15Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T03:23:16Z", "editor_id": 112437, "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Zhaoyuan Wang", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Tyler,</p>\n<p>Your focus on Finance and Information Systems is a strategic choice given the significant role of technology and information in the finance industry.

For example all the historical data of a company or creating it's valuation, or even when it comes to current information and the economic factors that causes fluctuations in the market. It definitely makes sense why Finance and Information systems is a good pari because of how much overlap there is. I also find it super cool how you have a plan to use private equity as a means to exit into another industry.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 114729, "anonymous_id": "2gix", "display_name": "Ashwin Vaidyanathan", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7527466/9consAP6sLGJDzhObHvgJGah3oGswGXppiMwZtBh", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/114729", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "read", "forced_read_state": false}, {"id": 1842048, "user_id": 47171, "parent_id": 1837359, "created_at": "2023-06-18T07:52:19Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-18T07:52:19Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Max Min", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Tyler,</p>\n<p>thank you for sharing about yourself. I think your two short-term and long-term goals can have a positive synergy leading to success in both. Working in a Venture-Capital firm sounds like an interesting career. I think that role would require good judgement and risk assessment. Technology and big data would surely help in that financial judgement. Data Analytics and Quantitative finance will lead you to big successes. I love your interest in decenteralised finance, as I was also very interested in how blockchain works. Web 2.0 ( NFT, cryptocurrencies, and metaverse) can cause a paradigm shift in the finance market as well.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 47171, "anonymous_id": "10eb", "display_name": "Max Min", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7672497/VZdOppW1pADfF8HSfeWlxPQQomctdguM4G2swvbv", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/47171", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}, {"id": 1841669, "user_id": 28176, "parent_id": 1837359, "created_at": "2023-06-17T20:53:48Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-17T20:53:48Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Curtis Smith", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hello Tyler,</p>\n<p>I find it amazing that both your short-term and long term goals each correlate with each other, somewhat similar to my aspirations.

Nice to meet you! I originally was an Accountancy and Finance major but found out that finance was not my favorite. Instead, I switch to Accountancy and Information Systems. You have such amazing goals! I hope you get to reach your goal of working for a venture capital firm. Really sounds that you could utilize this class a lot for future investment portfolios and for those block chains you mentioned! Yes, I totally&nbsp; agree that real world experience that you would get at an internship would be very helpful for your future career path.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 122702, "anonymous_id": "2moe", "display_name": "Sara Nemec", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7486043/FGfhWlP6Z4to4EcWCdhyyB9S7TTKQ8Lw0C00u5Zj", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/122702", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}, {"id": 1839760, "user_id": 122302, "parent_id": 1837359, "created_at": "2023-06-15T19:08:54Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-15T19:08:54Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Ryan Marks", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Tyler, I think it is very important to have short-term and long-term goals that go hand in hand such as yours. It makes it a lot easier to achieve both if working toward your short-term goals is very helpful in reaching your long-term goals as well. I would agree with you that real-world experience is the best way to learn and improve yourself. While classes are very important and there is a lot to learn from, you can't learn about the real world and real business environment and the skills you would need to be competitive there than by being in that environment yourself</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537563/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>", "user": {"id": 122302, "anonymous_id": "2mda", "display_name": "Ryan Marks", "avatar_image_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/images/thumbnails/7560010/BhV8RNilUT51Di2CPjiOf3VaBzHATBu9PgBJzCa0", "html_url": "https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/36263/users/122302", "pronouns": null}, "read_state": "unread", "forced_read_state": false}, {"id": 1838228, "user_id": 119098, "parent_id": 1837359, "created_at": "2023-06-14T04:31:17Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-14T04:31:17Z", "rating_count": null, "rating_sum": null, "user_name": "Jessica Yee", "message": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145590000000000001/attachments/5537564/canvas_global_app.css\"><p>Hi Tyler,</p>\n<p>I love that your short term and long term goals are intertwined and they push you to achieve a higher overall goal.
