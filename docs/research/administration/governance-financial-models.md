## 3. Financial Models & Cost Analysis

### 3.1 Revenue Sharing Models

Based on research into multi-college program finances, three primary models exist for distributing tuition revenue:

#### Model 1: Proportional Credit Hour Model (Recommended)

**Mechanism**: Revenue allocated to colleges/departments based on proportion of credit hours taught.

**Example Calculation**:
- AI Minor requires 18 credit hours total
- Computer Science teaches 9 credits (50%)
- Statistics teaches 6 credits (33%)
- Domain department teaches 3 credits (17%)

If program generates $180,000 in tuition revenue:
- Computer Science: $90,000
- Statistics: $60,000
- Domain department: $30,000
- Central administration overhead: 10% ($18,000 off top before split)

**Advantages**:
- Fair and transparent allocation
- Incentivizes departments to contribute courses
- Easy to calculate and audit
- Aligns with actual instructional costs
- Encourages quality teaching (departments want enrollments)

**Disadvantages**:
- May not account for course development costs
- Large intro courses subsidize smaller advanced courses
- Doesn't reward program coordination and advising labor
- Can create competition for student credit hours

**Best For**: Established programs with stable enrollment and course offerings

#### Model 2: Negotiated Fixed Split

**Mechanism**: Participating units agree on predetermined percentages regardless of actual teaching contribution.

**Example**:
- Computer Science: 40%
- Statistics: 30%
- Domain departments: 20%
- Central program office: 10%

**Advantages**:
- Predictable budgets for planning
- Can reward strategic contributions beyond teaching
- Reduces administrative overhead of tracking credit hours
- Allows flexibility in course offerings without budget impact

**Disadvantages**:
- May not reflect actual workload or costs
- Difficult to renegotiate when imbalanced
- Creates inequities if enrollment shifts
- Discourages innovation (no incentive to add courses)

**Best For**: Small pilot programs or partnerships with strong trust relationships

#### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Base + Variable

**Mechanism**: Combines fixed base allocation with variable component based on credit hours.

**Example**:
- Base allocation: 50% split equally among participating colleges
- Variable allocation: 50% split by credit hour delivery
- Central overhead: 10% off top

**Advantages**:
- Ensures all partners have stable base funding
- Rewards increased teaching contribution
- More equitable than pure proportional model
- Encourages both participation and effort

**Disadvantages**:
- More complex to calculate and administer
- Requires agreement on base vs. variable split
- May still create perceived inequities

**Best For**: Growing programs with evolving partnerships and variable enrollment

### 3.2 Cost-Sharing Framework

**Direct Costs** (allocated to teaching departments):
- Faculty salaries and benefits
- Course development and materials
- Teaching assistant support
- Laboratory and computational resources
- Instructional technology and software licenses

**Shared Costs** (funded centrally or split among partners):
- Program director salary and benefits
- Program coordinator and staff
- Student advising services
- Marketing and recruitment
- Assessment and accreditation
- Professional development

**Central/Overhead Costs** (funded by Provost or campus):
- Administrative infrastructure
- Student information systems
- Physical space and utilities
- Legal and compliance
- Institutional research and reporting

**Recommended Split for UIUC AI Program**:
1. **Teaching revenue**: 90% to departments based on credit hours, 10% to central program office
2. **Enrollment fees**: If AI-specific course fees charged, 50% to program office, 50% to teaching departments
3. **External grants/partnerships**: Negotiated based on contribution (typically PI department keeps 60-80%)

- **Potential surplus**: Programs can be revenue-neutral or positive by Year 3

### 3.4 Differential Tuition Considerations

**What is Differential Tuition?**
Higher tuition rates charged for specific programs or colleges to reflect additional instructional costs or market demand.

**Examples at Peer Institutions**:
- Engineering programs: +$500-$2,000 per semester
- Computer Science: +$300-$1,000 per semester
- Business programs: +$400-$1,500 per semester

**Arguments FOR Differential Tuition for AI Programs**:
1. **Higher instructional costs**: Specialized faculty, computational infrastructure, software licenses
2. **Market demand**: Strong employment outcomes justify premium pricing
3. **Competitive positioning**: Peer institutions charge differentials for CS/engineering
4. **Revenue sustainability**: Ensures program can maintain quality without subsidy
5. **Resource allocation**: Funds stay within program for student benefit

**Arguments AGAINST Differential Tuition**:
1. **Access and equity**: Creates financial barriers for underrepresented students
2. **Political challenges**: Student resistance, negative press, legislative scrutiny
3. **Enrollment impact**: May discourage students from pursuing AI minor
4. **Administrative complexity**: Tracking, billing, exceptions, financial aid adjustments
5. **Interdisciplinary goals**: AI should be accessible across all disciplines

**Recommendation for UIUC**:
- **Phase 1 (Years 1-3)**: NO differential tuition—focus on growth and adoption
- **Phase 2 (Years 4+)**: Consider modest course fee ($50-$100 per course) if needed for computational resources
- **Alternative**: Embed costs in existing engineering/LAS tuition structures using internal cost-sharing

### 7.6 Big Ten Universities AI Governance Study

**Overview**:
A 2024 study analyzed AI governance structures across 14 Big Ten universities, revealing diverse approaches to managing AI in higher education.

**Key Findings**:

**1. Multi-Unit Governance**
- AI guidelines published by multiple campus units: IT, Teaching & Learning, President's Office, Libraries, AI Centers
- Each unit focuses on domain-specific concerns (IT on security, Teaching & Learning on pedagogy)
- Decentralized approach fosters comprehensive coverage but complicates information access

**2. Role-Specific Guidance**
- Guidelines tailored to distinct roles: faculty, students, staff, researchers
- Most guidance oriented toward faculty (responsible for guiding student AI use)
- Students have less direct guidance but inherit faculty expectations

**3. Specialized AI Centers**
- Some universities (e.g., Northwestern, Penn State) have dedicated AI centers
- Centers focus on research, education broadcasting, and policy development
- Ambiguous role in governance; often advisory rather than authoritative

**4. Leadership Ambiguity**
- President/Provost offices have overlapping guidance with other units
- Central administration role in AI governance not clearly defined
- Decentralized model vs. centralized coordination tension

**Implications for UIUC AI Program**:
1. **Governance complexity**: Multi-unit AI governance is common but can confuse stakeholders
2. **Clear ownership**: UIUC should designate lead unit for AI academic programs (recommend Provost Office)
3. **Role-based guidance**: Develop AI minor guidance for faculty, students, advisors separately
4. **AI center role**: If UIUC creates AI center, clarify relationship to academic programs (research vs. education vs. governance)
5. **Coordination mechanisms**: Regular convening of AI stakeholders across units to align policies

**Recommendation**: UIUC should learn from Big Ten peers by establishing clear governance authority for AI academic programs while allowing distributed implementation.

## 10. Recommendations for UIUC

Based on comprehensive research of peer institutions, UIUC's existing programs (CS+X, X+DS), and best practices in interdisciplinary program administration, the following recommendations are made for implementing a campus-wide AI program at UIUC:

### 10.1 Administrative Structure

**Recommendation**: Adopt a **hybrid model with Provost coordination and distributed delivery**.

**Rationale**:
- Leverages UIUC's successful CS+X and X+DS models
- Balances centralized coordination with college autonomy
- Provides clear accountability while respecting departmental expertise
- More sustainable than pure centralized model (lower costs)
- More effective than pure distributed model (avoids fragmentation)

**Key Elements**:
- Program housed in Office of the Provost
- Program director (0.5 FTE faculty) + coordinator (1.0 FTE staff) + advisor (0.5-1.0 FTE)
- Advisory Council with associate deans from participating colleges
- Curriculum Committee with faculty from CS, Statistics, and domain areas
- Each college delivers courses and maintains faculty, central office coordinates

### 10.2 Governance Structure

**Recommendation**: Establish multi-level governance with clear decision-making authority.

**Governance Bodies**:
1. **Advisory Council** (strategic oversight): Associate deans + Provost designee (chair)
2. **Curriculum Committee** (academic standards): Faculty representatives + program director
3. **Program Director** (day-to-day operations): Reports to Associate Provost for Academic Affairs

**Decision-Making Authority**:
- Advisory Council: Program strategy, new variants, budget allocation, policy
- Curriculum Committee: Course approval, learning outcomes, curriculum standards
- Program Director: Operations, admissions, advising, marketing, assessment

**Key Success Factor**: Provost must actively support program and empower director to make decisions. Advisory Council should advise, not micromanage.

### 10.3 Housing and Organizational Placement

**Recommendation**: House program in **Office of the Provost** with strong partnerships across Grainger Engineering, LAS (Statistics), and iSchool.

**Rationale**:
- Neutral territory avoids perception of one college dominating
- Provost has convening authority and can mediate disputes
- Aligns with other interdisciplinary programs (Study Abroad, Honors, etc.)
- Facilitates approval processes and policy changes
- Signals institutional priority

**Alternative**: If Provost Office lacks capacity, consider housing in LAS (like CS+X) or creating lightweight AI coordinating office reporting to Provost. Avoid housing in Grainger Engineering alone (may discourage non-STEM participation).

### 10.4 Financial Model

**Recommendation**: **Proportional credit hour revenue sharing** with central program office receiving 10% overhead.

**Revenue Distribution**:
- 90% of tuition revenue allocated to teaching departments based on credit hours taught
- 10% to central program office for coordination, advising, marketing, assessment

**Cost-Sharing**:
- Departments cover faculty salaries, TA support, course materials
- Central office covers program director, coordinator, advisors, marketing, operations
- Shared costs (computational infrastructure, software) negotiated and split

**Startup Funding**:
- Provost commits $200K-$400K for Years 1-3 (declining subsidy as program grows)
- Each participating college contributes $20K-$40K annually for initial years
- Seek external grants (NSF, industry) for $100K-$150K startup support

**Sustainability**:
- Target revenue neutrality by Year 3 (enrollment of 250-300 students)
- Avoid differential tuition initially; revisit after Year 3 if needed

### 10.5 Resource Commitments

### 10.12 Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

Before proceeding with full program launch, UIUC should ensure the following conditions are met:

**Must-Have**:
1. ✅ **Executive Commitment**: Provost explicitly supports program and commits 3-year funding
2. ✅ **College Buy-In**: At least 3 colleges (Grainger, LAS, one other) sign MOUs committing faculty and resources
3. ✅ **Faculty Leadership**: Qualified program director candidate identified and committed
4. ✅ **Student Demand**: Market research shows 200+ students likely to enroll in first 2 years
5. ✅ **Curriculum Ready**: At least 4 core AI courses developed and approved
6. ✅ **Budget Secured**: Startup funding ($500K-$750K) committed by Provost and colleges

**Should-Have** (delay if not achieved):
- Computational infrastructure plan with NCSA/Technology Services partnership
- Industry advisory board with 5+ companies committed
- Advising plan with college advising offices trained
- Assessment framework developed and approved

**If Conditions Not Met**: Consider smaller pilot (AI certificate only, 1-2 colleges) rather than full minor program. Alternatively, defer launch until conditions can be met.

### 10.13 Final Recommendation

**UIUC should proceed with launching a campus-wide AI minor program using a hybrid governance model coordinated through the Office of the Provost.**

**Rationale**:
- Strong market demand for AI education
- UIUC has institutional strengths (top CS, Statistics, domain expertise across colleges)
- Proven models (CS+X, X+DS) provide template for interdisciplinary programs
- Modest startup costs ($500K-$750K) with path to sustainability by Year 3
- Strategic imperative: UIUC's peer institutions (Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern) are investing heavily in AI education; UIUC must compete

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. **Strong Provost Leadership**: Program needs visible executive champion who can convene colleges and allocate resources
2. **Dedicated Program Director**: Hire or appoint exceptional faculty leader with administrative skills and AI credibility
3. **Clear Governance**: Avoid governance-by-committee; empower director to make decisions within strategic framework
4. **Faculty Investment**: Recruit or develop AI-capable faculty across colleges, not just CS
5. **Student-Centered Design**: Keep program accessible, relevant, and responsive to student needs
6. **Continuous Innovation**: AI field evolves rapidly; program must stay current or become obsolete

**Next Steps**:
1. Provost convenes meeting with deans of Grainger, LAS, Gies to discuss AI program concept
2. If consensus to proceed, form planning committee and allocate planning budget ($50K-$100K)
3. Planning committee develops full proposal over 6-9 months
4. Submit proposal to Senate Educational Policy Committee and IBHE
5. Pending approvals, launch in 18-24 months

**With strong leadership, adequate resources, and commitment to quality, UIUC can establish a nationally recognized AI education program that serves hundreds of students and positions UIUC as a leader in interdisciplinary AI education.**
