## XI. Financial Analysis

### A. Total Cost Projections (5 Years)

| Year | Students | Faculty FTE | Staff FTE | Total Cost | Revenue (Tuition) | Net Cost |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **1** (2026-27) | 115 | 2.0 | 1.75 | $430K | $180K | **-$250K** |
| **2** (2027-28) | 225 | 3.0 | 2.5 | $625K | $360K | **-$265K** |
| **3** (2028-29) | 350 | 4.0 | 3.5 | $825K | $630K | **-$195K** |
| **4** (2029-30) | 450 | 5.0 | 4.0 | $975K | $900K | **-$75K** |
| **5** (2030-31) | 550 | 5.0 | 4.5 | $1,025K | $1,100K | **+$75K** |

**Cumulative Net Investment**: $1.03M over 5 years
**Break-Even Point**: Year 5 (potentially Year 4 with strong enrollment)
**Long-Term**: Revenue positive by Year 6+

### B. Funding Sources

**Provost Investment** (Years 1-3):
- $250K (Year 1) + $265K (Year 2) + $195K (Year 3) = **$710K total**
- Justification: Strategic investment in UIUC's AI leadership

**Participating Colleges** (Cost-sharing):
- Each X+AI program: $50K-$75K annually (offset by tuition revenue)
- Grainger, LAS, Gies, ACES: Share infrastructure costs

**External Funding** (potential):
- **Industry Partnerships**: IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Google (computing credits, scholarships, curriculum input)
- **Grants**: NSF IUSE, NEH, DoE education grants for curriculum development
- **Philanthropy**: Alumni donations for AI education initiatives
- **Estimated**: $200K-$400K over 5 years

**Reduced Net Investment with External Funding**: $610K-$810K over 5 years

### C. Revenue Assumptions

**Tuition Model**:
- Undergraduate tuition: ~$12K-$16K per year (in-state/out-of-state blended)
- Revenue share to AI programs: 30% of credits taught by AI program courses
- Average AI student takes 6 AI credits/year: $1,500-$2,000 revenue per student

**Enrollment Assumptions**:
- AI Minor: 50 (Y1) → 100 (Y2) → 200 (Y3) → 300 (Y4) → 400 (Y5)
- AI Certificate: 25 (Y1) → 50 (Y2) → 75 (Y3) → 100 (Y4) → 100 (Y5)
- X+AI Degrees: 0 (Y1) → 75 (Y2) → 75 (Y3) → 50 (Y4) → 50 (Y5)

**Conservative Estimates**: 80% of projected enrollment used in financial model

## XII. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### A. Major Risks

#### 1. Faculty Capacity Constraints
**Risk**: Insufficient faculty to teach new AI courses without overburdening existing faculty
**Likelihood**: High
**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
- Phased launch (pilot → scale gradually)
- Visiting faculty or lecturers for high-demand courses
- Cross-listing to maximize existing capacity
- Online/asynchronous delivery to reduce contact hours
- Teaching buyouts for faculty developing new courses

#### 2. Student Demand Lower Than Projected
**Risk**: Enrollment falls short of financial model assumptions
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (delays revenue neutrality)

**Mitigation**:
- Robust marketing campaign (launch 6 months before pilot)
- Student testimonials and success stories
- Industry partnership announcements (signals career value)
- Stackable credentials (lower commitment threshold)
- Monitor enrollment weekly; adjust offerings in real-time

#### 3. Curriculum Quality Concerns
**Risk**: Rapid development leads to subpar course quality, harming reputation
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
- Peer review of all new syllabi before approval
- Pilot courses with small enrollments (allows iteration)
- Student feedback after every course offering
- External advisory board reviews curriculum
- Faculty development workshops (Summer 2026)

#### 4. Multi-College Coordination Challenges
**Risk**: Competing priorities, bureaucracy, slow decision-making
**Likelihood**: High (UIUC precedent from CS+X launch)
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Provost-level leadership (authority to break logjams)
- Clear governance documents (decision rights, timelines)
- Regular steering committee meetings (monthly)
- Dedicated program director (faculty with release time)
- Celebrate early wins to build momentum

#### 5. Equity & Access Gaps
**Risk**: Program inadvertently excludes underrepresented groups
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (reputational, ethical)

**Mitigation**:
- Intentional prerequisite design (Applications track has lower barriers)
- Bridge courses for students from underresourced backgrounds
- Scholarships for AI courses (need-based)
- Proactive advising for first-generation, underrepresented students
- Track demographic data; intervene if disparities emerge

#### 6. Rapidly Changing AI Landscape
**Risk**: Curriculum becomes outdated quickly; industry needs shift
**Likelihood**: High
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Annual curriculum review (adjust electives, update content)
- Industry advisory board provides real-time feedback
- Modular course design (easy to swap topics)
- Emphasize fundamentals over tools (principles endure)
- Faculty professional development (conferences, industry sabbaticals)

### B. Success Factors

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. ✅ **Strong Provost Leadership**: Visible, sustained commitment
2. ✅ **Cross-College Buy-In**: Deans actively support, not just tolerate
3. ✅ **Faculty Champions**: Enthusiastic faculty in each college
4. ✅ **Student Demand**: Strong enrollment from multiple disciplines
5. ✅ **Employer Validation**: Industry partners hire and praise graduates
6. ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Assessment shows learning outcomes achieved
7. ✅ **Equity Outcomes**: Diverse students succeed at equal rates

## XIV. Conclusion

### A. Opportunity Ahead

UIUC stands at a critical juncture. AI is transforming every discipline, and students across campus need AI literacy and skills. Yet most universities are just beginning to grapple with AI education at scale.

**UIUC's Advantages**:
- Top-5 AI research program with world-class faculty
- Proven track record with interdisciplinary programs (CS+X, X+DS)
- Substantial infrastructure ($270M in AI funding, DeltaAI, industry partnerships)
- Strong task force with diverse expertise and commitment

**The Opportunity**: UIUC can become the national leader in undergraduate AI education—not just for CS majors, but for ALL students. The dual-track AI minor, stackable credentials, and X+AI blended degrees position UIUC to educate the AI-literate workforce of tomorrow.

### B. Risks of Inaction

**If UIUC does not act**:
- Students graduate without AI skills, disadvantaged in job market
- Peer universities establish AI education leadership (Georgia Tech, Northwestern already ahead)
- Industry partners look elsewhere for AI talent pipelines
- UIUC's reputation as innovation leader diminishes

**The cost of inaction exceeds the cost of investment.**

### C. Call to Action

This research provides evidence-based recommendations across all six Provost charges. The path forward is clear:

1. **December 19, 2025**: Task force endorses core recommendations in short summary
2. **January 19, 2026**: Full report submitted with detailed implementation plan
3. **February 2026**: Steering committee formed, director hiring initiated
4. **Fall 2026**: Pilot launch of AI Minor and Certificate
5. **Fall 2027**: X+AI degree programs begin

**The time to act is now.** UIUC has the expertise, resources, and institutional capacity to lead the nation in AI education. This task force has the opportunity to shape UIUC's future—and the future of thousands of students—for decades to come.
