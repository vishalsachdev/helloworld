## 8. Assessment and Evaluation Approaches

### 8.1 Alignment with Learning Outcomes

**Principle:** Assessment should directly measure stated learning outcomes

**Example Alignment:**
- **Outcome:** "Apply ML algorithms to solve real-world problems"
- **Assessment:** Project where students build and evaluate ML model for authentic dataset
- **Not Aligned:** Multiple choice exam on ML definitions

### 8.2 Competency-Based Assessment

**Definition:** Students demonstrate mastery of specific competencies; emphasis on what they can do

**Key Components:**

**Clear Competencies:**
- 3-9 specific, measurable skills or knowledge areas
- Observable and assessable
- Aligned with course outcomes
- Communicated clearly to students

**Performance Levels:**
- Novice: Basic understanding, needs significant support
- Developing: Growing competency, some independence
- Proficient: Meets expectations, works independently
- Advanced: Exceeds expectations, can teach others

**Multiple Demonstrations:**
- Students show competency across different contexts
- Not just one high-stakes exam
- Portfolio of evidence
- Progression over time

**Mastery Requirements:**
- Must reach "Proficient" or higher
- Can retake/revise until mastery
- Focus on learning, not sorting

### 8.3 Rubric Design for AI Assignments

**Purpose:**
- Consistent, objective grading
- Timely, specific feedback
- Clear expectations for students
- Faster grading for instructors

**Components of Effective Rubrics:**

**1. Alignment:**
- Criteria match learning outcomes
- Criteria match assignment requirements
- Weighted appropriately

**2. Specificity:**
- Clear descriptors for each performance level
- Observable, measurable criteria
- Examples when helpful

**3. Comprehensiveness:**
- Cover all important dimensions
- Include both technical and professional skills
- Ethics and responsible AI use

**Sample Rubric Dimensions for AI Project:**

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Problem Definition | 10% | Clear statement of problem, stakeholders, success criteria |
| Data Quality | 15% | Appropriate data collection, cleaning, ethical considerations |
| Model Development | 25% | Algorithm selection, implementation, hyperparameter tuning |
| Evaluation | 20% | Rigorous evaluation, appropriate metrics, analysis of results |
| Ethical Considerations | 15% | Bias assessment, fairness analysis, stakeholder impact |
| Communication | 10% | Clear documentation, effective presentation, visualizations |
| Code Quality | 5% | Readable, efficient, well-documented code |

**Using AI to Create Rubrics:**
- Provide: assignment details, learning outcomes, criteria, rubric type, scoring scale
- AI generates draft rubric
- **Critical:** Human review and refinement required
- Iterate based on student performance and feedback

### 8.4 AI-Enabled Assessment Tools

**Automated Grading:**
- Code assignments: unit tests, style checks
- Quizzes: immediate feedback on objective questions
- Essay scoring: AI-assisted (with caution and human review)
- Saves substantial time, especially in large courses

**AI-Assisted Peer Review:**
- AI helps students provide better feedback
- Flags reviews that are too brief or generic
- Suggests areas reviewers might have missed
- Human students still do the evaluation

**Plagiarism and AI-Use Detection:**
- Tools like Turnitin, GPTZero
- **Critical consideration:** False positives harm students
- Use as diagnostic, not punitive
- Focus on teaching proper attribution
- Shift assignments to be AI-resistant or AI-integrated

**Personalized Feedback at Scale:**
- AI can draft individualized comments
- Instructor reviews and sends
- Faster turnaround for students
- More detailed than generic comments

**Adaptive Testing:**
- Difficulty adjusts based on student performance
- More efficient measurement of ability
- Reduces test anxiety (appropriate challenge level)
- Implementation in learning platforms

### 8.5 Formative vs. Summative Assessment

**Formative (Low-Stakes, Frequent):**
- **Purpose:** Inform instruction and guide learning
- **Examples:** Quick polls, exit tickets, practice quizzes, peer feedback
- **Frequency:** Multiple times per week
- **Grading:** Minimal or participation-based

**Summative (Higher-Stakes, Periodic):**
- **Purpose:** Evaluate achievement of outcomes
- **Examples:** Exams, major projects, presentations, portfolios
- **Frequency:** 3-5 times per semester
- **Grading:** Significant portion of final grade

**Balance:**
- More formative than summative
- Use formative to prepare for summative
- Align both with learning outcomes
- Provide feedback loops

### 8.6 Alternative Assessment Methods

**Portfolios:**
- Collection of best work throughout course
- Demonstrates growth over time
- Student reflection on learning
- Authentic showcase for employers

**Presentations:**
- Oral communication skills
- Explaining technical concepts to different audiences
- Q&A demonstrates depth of understanding
- Peer evaluation component

**Self and Peer Assessment:**
- Develops metacognition
- Students learn evaluation criteria deeply
- Promotes responsibility for learning
- Calibrated with instructor grading

**Process Documentation:**
- Require students to show their work
- Problem-solving process, not just solution
- Jupyter notebooks with narrative
- Reflection on challenges and decisions

**Ungrading or Minimal Grading:**
- Focus on feedback, not points
- Students self-assess against criteria
- Conversations about progress
- Final grade by portfolio or self-assessment with instructor validation

### 8.7 Addressing Challenges with Gen AI in Assessment

**The Problem:**
- Students can use ChatGPT, Claude, etc. to complete assignments
- Traditional assessments may no longer measure individual learning

**Response Strategies:**

**1. AI-Integrated Assignments**
- Require use of AI tools, then critique outputs
- Evaluate student's evaluation of AI work
- Document prompts and iteration process
- Reflection on when AI helped vs. hindered

**2. AI-Resistant Assessments**
- In-class exams or presentations
- Problem-solving that requires domain knowledge AI lacks
- Critique of AI-generated solutions (find errors)
- Novel problems not in training data

**3. Process-Focused Evaluation**
- Show all steps, not just final product
- Document decision-making process
- Explain why chosen approaches
- Versions/iterations required

**4. Authentic Tasks**
- Real clients or datasets
- Contextualized problems
- Ethical analysis specific to context
- Collaboration and communication emphasized

**5. Honor Code and Education**
- Clear policies on AI use
- Explain why policies exist (learning goals)
- Model appropriate AI use
- Discuss academic integrity regularly
