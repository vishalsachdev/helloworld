- University approved the CS+X interdisciplinary programs in 2013
- First freshmen matriculated in Fall 2014
- Template created in 2014 for "computer science plus LAS option"
- As of Fall 2022: 1,098 students enrolled across CS+X programs vs. 1,296 in straight CS program

**Current CS+X Concentrations** (spanning 5 colleges):

*College of Liberal Arts & Sciences (LAS):*
- CS + Anthropology
- CS + Astronomy
- CS + Chemistry
- CS + Economics (highest enrollment: 156 students as of Fall 2022)

Program websites: [Blended CS Degrees](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/cs-x-degree-programs), [CS+X Expansion News](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/news/groundbreaking-cs-x-degrees-expand-into-bioengineering-and-physics)

### B. Curriculum Design

**Core Philosophy:**
- Students get a strong foundation in computer science that isn't a "watered down degree"
- Regular CS students take upper-level electives in different CS specialties
- CS+X students take advanced courses in their "X" field instead of CS electives
- CS+X degrees require fewer technical prerequisites than straight CS

**Example: CS+Anthropology Requirements**
- 8 courses from Anthropology
- 9-10 courses from Computer Science
- Balanced integration of both disciplines

**Key Features:**
- Core CS offerings run through Grainger College of Engineering
- Collaboration with faculty across UIUC colleges
- True interdisciplinary exploration at the intersection of CS and other academic fields
- Multi-college governance structure maintains rigorous standards in both disciplines

### C. Governance Model

**Approval Process:**
- Proposals submitted through Curriculum Inventory Management (CIM) system
- When proposal impacts other units' resources, Senate Committee on Educational Policy (EP) requires written confirmation
- Proposals approved at unit and college levels, then sent to Office of the Provost
- Interdisciplinary curriculum committees manage ongoing curriculum decisions

**Administrative Structure:**
- Multi-college collaboration model
- Each program involves partnership between:
  - Siebel School of Computing and Data Science
  - Partner college/department hosting the "X" discipline
- Shared governance and resource allocation

### D. Lessons Learned & Outcomes

**Challenges Identified:**

1. **Program Design Challenge**: The department hosting X must have clear understanding of what CS+X program would look like and, critically, **why it should exist**. Articulating the value proposition is essential.

2. **Curriculum Negotiation**: Each participating department must be prepared to **reduce their requirements** to create space for the interdisciplinary blend.

3. **Perception Management**: As novel programs, CS+X fields face scrutiny, rumors, and misinformation. Need active communication to address misconceptions.

**Success Factors:**

1. **Academic Rigor Maintained**: Difficulty level between CS and CS+X is nearly identical. Both populations learn the same fundamental computing principles, with tailored applications for CS+X students.

2. **Career Preparation**: CS majors and CS+X students take the same fundamental CS courses, making both equally equipped for technology careers (data analysts, software engineers, etc.).

3. **Strong Enrollment Growth**: Programs have grown from 4 initial offerings in 2014 to 14 programs by 2023, with 1,098 students enrolled.

4. **Selectivity**: CS+X acceptance rate of 18.5% (vs. traditional CS <7%) demonstrates competitiveness while providing alternative pathway.

5. **Inspired Further Innovation**: Success of CS+X programs directly inspired creation of X+DS programs.

**Student Outcomes:**
- Graduates work across technology sector
- Equal preparation for computing careers compared to traditional CS majors
- Unique interdisciplinary expertise valued by employers
- Strong placement in data science, software engineering, and domain-specific technical roles

**Key Recommendations from CS+X Experience:**

1. **Start with Clear Value Proposition**: Articulate why the interdisciplinary combination matters before designing curriculum
2. **Expect Curriculum Negotiation**: Both departments must compromise on requirements
3. **Invest in Communication**: Proactively address misconceptions about program rigor and outcomes
4. **Maintain Shared Core**: Ensure fundamental CS education matches traditional program
5. **Support Multi-College Governance**: Create clear administrative structures for collaboration
6. **Monitor Enrollment Trends**: Track student interest to identify successful combinations

**UIUC Growth Path:**
- CS+X: 4 programs (2014) → 14 programs (2023)
- X+DS: 4 programs (2023), learning from CS+X

**Recommended Approach:**
- Launch 2-4 pilot interdisciplinary programs
- Choose disciplines with clear value proposition
- Monitor enrollment, student success, career outcomes
- Expand to additional disciplines based on data
- Plan for 5-10 year growth trajectory

#### 8. Leverage Student Community

**Student Organizations:**
- Support AI-focused student clubs
- Facilitate project-based learning
- Connect students across departments
- Industry networking events

**Peer Learning:**
- Study groups and tutoring
- Student-led workshops
- Hackathons and competitions
- Mentorship programs

#### 9. Develop Assessment Infrastructure

**Track Key Metrics:**
- Enrollment trends by program
- Student demographics (broadening participation)
- Time to degree completion
- Career outcomes (employment rates, sectors, salaries)
- Graduate school placement
- Employer satisfaction

**Use Data for Improvement:**
- Identify struggling students early
- Adjust curriculum based on outcomes
- Demonstrate program value to stakeholders
- Inform resource allocation decisions

**UIUC Gap:** X+DS too new for comprehensive outcome data - build assessment from program launch

#### 10. Communicate Value Proactively

**UIUC Lesson:**
- CS+X faced perception challenges as "novel program"
- Required active communication about rigor and outcomes
- Myths needed explicit debunking

**Recommendation:**
- Develop clear messaging about AI program value
- Share student and alumni success stories
- Publish outcome data transparently
- Engage with employers to demonstrate graduate quality
- Address misconceptions proactively
