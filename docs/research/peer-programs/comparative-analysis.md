**Universities Analyzed**: 12 top-tier institutions (MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Georgia Tech, University of Michigan, Purdue, UW-Madison, Northwestern, Ohio State, Penn State, University of Minnesota)

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

1. **AI Minor Adoption**: 7 of 12 universities offer dedicated undergraduate AI minors, with most launching between 2024-2025
2. **Interdisciplinary Design**: Leading programs emphasize cross-college collaboration (Georgia Tech, Northwestern, CMU)
3. **Dual-Track Models**: Georgia Tech pioneered separate engineering and liberal arts tracks within the same minor
4. **Scalable Delivery**: Stanford leads in online certificate delivery; MOOCs successfully scaling to 160,000+ students
5. **Stackable Credentials**: Penn State and Harvard pioneered certificate-to-degree pathways
6. **Emerging Trend**: "AI+X" blended degrees just launching (BGSU first in nation, Fall 2025)

### Critical Patterns

- **Credit Range**: Minors range from 15-26 credits (5-7 courses)
- **Prerequisites**: All require foundational math (calculus/linear algebra) and programming
- **Exclusions**: Most exclude CS majors from AI minors (they have major concentrations instead)
- **Cross-College**: Successful programs span 2+ colleges with multi-unit governance
- **Ethics Integration**: All programs include AI ethics/societal impact coursework

### Best Practices for UIUC

1. **Adopt dual-track model** (technical vs. applications-focused) like Georgia Tech
2. **Implement stackable credentials** from micro-certificates → certificates → minor → degree
3. **Create cross-college governance** structure with dedicated AI oversight committee
4. **Exclude CS majors** but offer CS+AI concentration within major
5. **Leverage online/hybrid delivery** for scalability beyond traditional enrollment limits
6. **Partner with multiple colleges** (Engineering, LAS, Business, Communications) from launch

## Conclusion

This comparative analysis reveals several clear trends in AI education at peer universities:

1. **AI minors are rapidly proliferating** (7 of 12 universities), with most launching 2024-2025
2. **Dual-track models** (Georgia Tech) and **human-centered approaches** (Michigan) serve both technical and applications-oriented students
3. **Stackable credentials** (Penn State, Harvard) provide flexible pathways from micro-certificates to full degrees
4. **Cross-college governance** is essential for successful, broad-reaching programs
5. **Scalable delivery** via online/hybrid formats enables reaching thousands beyond traditional capacity
6. **Ethics integration** is now standard across all programs

**For UIUI**, the path forward is clear:
- Adopt Georgia Tech's dual-track model
- Implement Penn State's stackable credentials
- Establish cross-college governance with multi-unit oversight
- Leverage online/hybrid delivery for scale
- Partner with Engineering, LAS, Business, and Media from launch
- Start small (50-100 students), iterate quickly, scale based on demand

The universities analyzed here demonstrate that AI education is no longer the exclusive domain of computer science departments. The most successful programs are interdisciplinary, accessible, and designed for the diverse needs of students across all disciplines who will use AI in their careers.

**UIUC has the opportunity to learn from these peer institutions and build a best-in-class AI minor that serves the entire campus, positions graduates for AI-integrated careers, and establishes UIUC as a leader in interdisciplinary AI education.**
