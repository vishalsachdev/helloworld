# Experiment Notes

Each experiment lives on its own branch (see `README.md` for workflow) and should capture a short record here so others can understand what was tried.

## How to log an experiment

1) Create or update a file named after your branch, e.g. `docs/experiments/exp-imba-search.md`.
2) Paste the template below and fill in the details as you work.
3) Keep notes concise: decisions made, data touched, tests run, and next steps.

## Template

```md
# Experiment: <branch-name>
- Owner: <name or handle>
- Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Goal: <what you're trying to learn or ship>

## Plan
- <step 1>
- <step 2>

## Changes
- <code / data / docs touched>

## Results
- <outcomes, measurements, blockers>

## Follow-ups
- <next actions or questions>
```
