# Experiment: exp-factorio-skills-vishal

- **Owner**: vishal
- **Date**: 2025-12-26
- **Goal**: Build a Factorio-inspired browser game that teaches agentic coding skills

## Motivation

There's a widely-observed correlation between Factorio expertise and success with agentic coding tools. This experiment explores whether we can:
1. Create a game that explicitly teaches these transferable skills
2. Learn the skills ourselves by building the game
3. Document the mental model mappings

## Plan

- [ ] Define MVP mechanics (simplified Factorio core loop)
- [ ] Create grid-based world with resource nodes
- [ ] Implement conveyor belt system (data flow visualization)
- [ ] Add assemblers (agent-like processors)
- [ ] Create throughput visualization (bottleneck detection)
- [ ] Add blueprint system (reusable compositions)

## Skill Mapping Reference

| Factorio | Agentic Coding | Learning Goal |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Conveyor belts | Data pipelines | Think in flows, not discrete ops |
| Assemblers | Specialized agents | Match tool to task |
| Inserters | Context injection | Control what agents "see" |
| Power grid | Token budget | Resource constraints |
| Bottlenecks | Rate limits | Identify slow points |
| Blueprints | Agent compositions | Reuse patterns |

## Changes
- 2025-12-26: Initial setup, documented skill mappings

## Results
- [In progress]

## Follow-ups
- Consider adding "challenges" that mirror real agentic coding scenarios
- Explore whether game metrics correlate with coding performance
