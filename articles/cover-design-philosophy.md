# Cover Design Philosophy: Teaching Claude Code to Remember

## Visual Concept

**Theme:** Memory, structure, and guidance - visualized as interconnected nodes forming a protective constellation

**Metaphor:** The article is about building systems that remember for you. Visually, this translates to:
- A network/constellation of connected elements (representing the architecture)
- A subtle "guide path" or flow lines (representing the guardrails)
- Warm, approachable colors (this isn't cold automation—it's helpful infrastructure)

## Color Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Deep Slate | #1e293b | Background, grounding |
| Warm Amber | #f59e0b | Primary accent, "memory" nodes |
| Soft Coral | #fb7185 | Secondary accent, connections |
| Light Cream | #fef3c7 | Text, highlights |
| Muted Teal | #5eead4 | Tertiary, subtle accents |

## Typography

- **Title:** Bold, modern sans-serif (clean and readable)
- **Subtitle/Branding:** Lighter weight, smaller
- Style: Technical but warm, not cold/robotic

## Visual Elements

1. **Memory Nodes:** Small circles/dots representing pieces of the system
2. **Connection Lines:** Thin lines linking nodes, suggesting architecture
3. **Flow Arrows:** Subtle directional hints showing the session flow
4. **Code Hint:** Small `{ }` or terminal-style element as nod to technical content

## Composition by Format

### LinkedIn (1200×628)
- Title centered, large
- Node network as background texture
- "The Hybrid Builder" branding bottom-right
- Balanced, professional

### Substack (1100×220)
- Extreme horizontal: flowing network left-to-right
- Title on left third, network flowing right
- Suggests movement/flow of the session workflow

### Twitter (1200×675)
- Similar to LinkedIn but slightly more vertical space
- Can include subtitle
- Node network more prominent

## Mood

Approachable technical sophistication. This isn't about cold automation—it's about building helpful infrastructure that makes future work easier. Warm amber tones balance the technical subject matter.
